# plotstyle
My personal matplotlib sylesheet =)

In case you face problems, after cloning the repository bear in mind that:
    1. Any .mplstyle file should be inside a folder called "stylelib"
    2. Add export MPLCONFIGDIR="$HOME/path/to/repo/folder" to the .bashrc file
    3. SOURCE THE .bashrc FILE!!
